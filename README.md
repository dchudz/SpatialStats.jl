## Todo next:

- optimize covariance function parameters
	- generalize optimize call SpatialStats_test.jl into a "fit" method
	- make a "predict" method
- plot multiple realizations of variogram from given process in a row for model checking
- show "theoretical" line with variability range (from simulating, probability)
- test for non-stationarity?


- put examples in here and convert it to Judo'd markdown? https://github.com/dchudz/Judo.jl/blob/master/src/Judo.jl#L271
