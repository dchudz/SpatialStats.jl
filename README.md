## Todo next:

- parametrize covariance functions better -- e.g. as some kind of type?
- plot multiple realizations of variogram from given process in a row for model checking
- show "theoretical" line with variability range (from simulating, probability)
- optimize covariance function parameters 
- test for non-stationarity?


- put examples in here and convert it to Judo'd markdown? https://github.com/dchudz/Judo.jl/blob/master/src/Judo.jl#L271
